# Cmd-rs
Cmd-rs is an attempt to build a library which helps to build interactive commandline apps with ease.  
It was inspired by the cmd module in python and the excellent [cmd2](https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2) library.  
## Usage
To use this library you can set the dependency which points to this git repository, since it has not been published on crates.io yet.  

```toml
[dependencies]
cmd-rs = { git = "https://github.com/pauliyobo/cmd-rs"}
```

A simple example which just prints the text test when invoked is the following:

```rust
use cmd_rs::{make_command, CommandProcessor, Result};

#[make_command]
fn test() -> Result<()> {
    println!("test");
    Ok(())
}

fn main() {
    CommandProcessor::new()
        .with_prompt(">")
        .run();
}
```

There is also another example in the examples directory.
## Roadmap
I started building cmd-rs also to gain more experience with the rust programming language, so The API  will most likely break a lot. Sorry for the inconvenience. However those are  some of the steps I'd like to get done at some point, in no particular order.
* [ ] Adding validation when calling commands. E.G. the library should error if a command contains whitespace.
* [ ] Adding more documentation 
* [ ] Even if this probably at a later stage. Adding a CI pipeline. perhaps github actions?
* [ ] add pre-commit hook to lint and format code instead of having to do that manually
* [ ] Adding tests where possible
* [ ] publishing on crates.io
